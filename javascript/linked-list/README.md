# Challenge Title
## Linked List

## Instructions

Node
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Linked List
- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
- Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

The class should contain the following methods:


**insert**
- Arguments: value
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.


**includes**
- Arguments: value
- Returns: Boolean
- Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.


**to string**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Tests

Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Solution
node index.js
