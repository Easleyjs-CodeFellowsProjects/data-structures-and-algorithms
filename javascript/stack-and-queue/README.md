# Challenge Title
## Stack and Queue

## Instructions

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

### Stack
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.

The class should contain the following methods:

**push**
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

**pop**
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

**peek**
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

**isEmpty**
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

The class should contain the following methods:

**enqueue**
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

**dequeue**
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
Removes the node from the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty queue

**peek**
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty stack

**isEmpty**
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Tests
Can successfully push onto a stack
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
Can successfully pop off the stack
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
Can successfully enqueue into a queue
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
