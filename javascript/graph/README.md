# Challenge Title
## Graph

## Description
Implement a Graph data structure in JS

## Requirements (methods)

**add vertex**
Arguments: value
Returns: The added vertex
Add a vertex to the graph

**add edge**
- Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph

If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both vertices should already be in the Graph

**get vertices**
- Arguments: none
- Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

**get neighbors**
- Arguments: vertex
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex

Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

**size**
- Arguments: none
- Returns the total number of vertices in the graph: 0 if there are none
