# Challenge Title
## Linked List Extended

## Instructions
We need to extend the existing linked list with a few methods. I'll also be changing the type of linked list it produces to a doubly-linked list to facilitate some of the methods.


Linked List

The class should contain the following methods:

**append**
- arguments: new value
- adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

**insertBefore**
- arguments: value, new value
- adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

**insertAfter**
- arguments: value, new value
- adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Tests
- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

## Solution
node index.js
