# Challenge Title
## Graph - Business Trip

## Description
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Requirements (methods)

Sample data:

**Verticies**
Pandora
Arendelle
Metroville
Monstropolis
Naboo
Narnia

**Edges**
Narnia -> Naboo (250)
Narnia -> Metroville (37)
Metroville -> Naboo (26)

Metroville -> Arendelle (99)
Metroville -> Pandora (82)
Metroville -> Monstropolis (105)

Pandora -> Arendelle (150)
Arendelle -> Monstropolis (42)
Monstropolis -> Naboo (73)




## Tests
Vertex can be successfully added to the graph
An edge can be successfully added to the graph
A collection of all vertices can be properly retrieved from the graph
All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
Neighbors are returned with the weight between vertices included
The proper size is returned, representing the number of vertices in the graph
A graph with only one vertex and edge can be properly returned
